    <h2>Recipe of Butternut Squash Lasagna</h2>
    <p>If your inner skeptic emerges and your eyes glaze over when you hear the words vegetarian and lasagna in the same sentence, then you should open those eyes. No one can call this cheesy, creamy butternut squash vegetarian lasagna boring.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 butternut squashes (about 2 pounds each)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the squashes with a vegetable peeler. Cut them in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. Then cut crosswise into 1/4-inch thick slices. (See How to Peel and Cut a Butternut Squash)</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Lay the slices on the baking sheet and brush with the olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake for 18 to 25 minutes, or until tender.</li>
