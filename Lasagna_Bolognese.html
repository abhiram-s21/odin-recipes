    <h2>Recipe of Lasagna Bolognese</h2>
    <p>This isn't a quick and easy lasagna. This is a slow and divine lasagna. A memorable lasagna. And we have a Simply Recipes reader to thank for it.</p>
    <p>The recipe given was a little incomplete; I had to fill in the blanks by referring to a few cookbooks. But it sounded so good that we just had to try it.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ounces diced pancetta, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium Spanish onion or yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 rib celery, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine pancetta, onion, celery, and carrot in saut√© pan with butter and cook over medium heat until onion turns pale gold.</li>
        <li>Add the beef, pork, and sausage to the soffritto and increase the heat to high. Cook until browned. Sprinkle with the ground clove, cinnamon, and pepper.</li>
